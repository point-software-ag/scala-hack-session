Scala Hack Session
======================
Welcome to Scala Hack Session. What is the best way to start a new language?

1. Code immediately following this step-by-step sessions
2. Read further materials and resources provided by each sessions   

Remember some old C64 games like [Tetris](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Fp26rVXF0) or [Bubble Bobble](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gggp9JkY1Pk)? Each level was not bigger than a screen and so are the sessions.

# ToC - Scala Hack Sessions
The following hack sessions are available:

1. [Scala Principles](01-principles/README.md)

# Is there a good way to start a new language?
What about...

1. Start hacking immediately and
2. Read further materials in the meanwhile?

One advantage of Scala is its [interactive interpreter](http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/first-steps-in-scala.html#step1).
Like in a worksheet file: you can enter code and get immediate output.
This way gets you quickly into Scala. Another goal is to encourage you to dive deeper. 

# How are the sessions organized?
Remember some old C64 games like [Tetris](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Fp26rVXF0) or [Bubble Bobble](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gggp9JkY1Pk)?
Each level was not bigger than a screen and so are the hack sessions.
All sessions are in form of a Scala source code and worksheets.
You can jump into each package, work through each exercises and compare them with the provided solutions.
In case you have alternate solutions you are free to pull a request to my GitHub repository (TODO Link).

# Social Coding
Feedback, additional exercises, and alternative solutions from you are appeciated. In case you have alternate solutions you are free to pull a request to my GitHub repository.
